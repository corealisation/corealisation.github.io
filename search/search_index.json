Rather, they need to understand and appreciate the social relationships that  make up our lives.</p> <p>Software engineering has made much progress in ensuring that software does behave the way its creators intended it to. Unfortunately, as argued in a recent discussion paper, there has not been similar progress in ensuring that this behavior serves the needs of the users, others affected by the use of the software.</p> <p>In response, there is a renewed interest in technology ethics as expressed, for example initiatives to teach computer science students the fundamentals of ethics. The embedded ethics initiative at Harvard is an example of such efforts. Similarly, law makers in a range of jurisdictions are working on  regulatory mechanisms.</p> <p>However, while these efforts are certainly useful when used diligently, they need translating into software engineering practice. Software engineers have languages for expressing functional behavior of software but lack a vocabulary  for the right social relations that make up our human world. This is why we are working on a set of tools that are inspired by [behavior-driven development] (BDD) and aim to do for the question \"are we building the right software\" what BDD did for the question \"are we building the software right?\"</p> <p>Over the coming weeks and months you should see some activity here in this space, so stay tuned.</p>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""}]}
