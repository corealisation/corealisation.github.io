# Setting up a new blog!

Testing the awesome [blog plugin] provided by [Material for MkDocs]. This is
part of my work on a tutorial for setting up a blog using these tools. At the
same time, this blog will serve a good purpose in the future, to provide a 
source of news for free software that helps people write software that is driven
by an appreciations of the social world in which software gets used. Read on if 
you want to learn a bit more. I will keep things short for now and will discuss
the ideas and the tools we are developing in future posts..

## The need for new approaches in software engineering

While software systems have long had an impact on our well-being, the extent to 
which software permeates our lives today makes it even more important that
development teams consider not just individual usability and user experience.
Rather, they need to understand and appreciate the social relationships that 
make up our lives.

Software engineering has made much progress in ensuring that software does
behave the way its creators intended it to. Unfortunately, as [argued in a
recent discussion paper], there has not been similar progress in ensuring that
this behavior serves the needs of the users, others affected by the use of the
software.
